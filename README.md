# Working with developers

A few bits of advice to work more effectively with developers.


## Cross communication

-	The more people you have on your team, the more points of cross communication you have
-	Generally, you should try to make sure that people who don’t need to be involved in a conversation, can leave and are free to continue with their work
-	If 5 people are in a meeting and spend 20 minutes talking about something that’s only relevant to 2 of them, an hour of time is lost
-	As you add more people to a problem, meeting or decision, it exponentially increases the cross communication overhead

## Adding people can increase development time

-	Please read [The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month), it was published in 1975 but is still scarily relevant 

## Interruptions

-	Developing code means getting your head deeply in to a problem/system.
-	It can sometimes take 30 minutes or so to get warmed up to what you need to do, getting your head in a state where it fully understands the system you’re working on and how you’re going to adapt it.
-	Slack channels can be a good place to have conversations, as developers can check them when they’re between tasks. Try not to trigger notifications unless needed.
- If a developer has headphones on, unless you know otherwise assume they're doing so in order to discourage people from interupting them. Consider whether you could email or message them on Slack rather than interupt them.

## Stand ups

-	It’s best to try to keep these short – encourage further conversation after the stand up without having the conversation in the stand up
-	Generally each person (not just developers) should only outline (1) what they worked on yesterday, (2) what they plan to work on today, (3) what is blocking them from continuing their work
-	Allow everyone in the team to stop and listen to each other member of the team once a day and 
-	The hardest thing, is when you hear someone say something that you want to input on, is you should note it down and discuss with them later rather than have the conversation in the stand up. Developers find it hard to do this themselves, they should also be encouraged to stay on point. It’s very easy to have standups last 30 minutes plus and wasting a lot of developer time
